Quick Start
-----------

At it's core, Navi is just a router. You can use it with any React app â€“ just add the `navi` and `react-navi` packages to your project:

```bash
npm install --save navi react-navi
```

If you'd like a more full featured starter, you can get started with [Create React/Navi App](https://frontarm.com/navi/create-react-navi-app/):

```bash
npx create-react-navi-app my-app
cd my-app
npm start
```

Or if you want to create a blog, use [create-react-blog](https://github.com/frontarm/create-react-blog):

```bash
npx create-react-blog react-blog
cd react-blog
npm start
```
